### What's DekaDico?

It's a memory training app, which is intended for those interested in improving their recall skills of spoken numbers. 'Spoken Numbers' is a discipline in all memory competitions. The aim is to commit to memory and recall as many Spoken Numbers as possible, which are read out at a pace of 1 digit per second. Getting better at such a skill would not just improve your memory skills, but also enhance your focus and concentration.

### Get Started with Memorization!

* If you are a newbie into the world of mnemonics and memorization, this is probably the best resouce to get you going : [ArtOfMemory](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Main_Page/)

* Once you have familiarized with the basic memorization techniques, you can move on to more interesting methods used by memory athletes like Person-Action-Object, Major system, Dominic system, Ben's system etc. You can pick one as the weapon of your choice or create one on your own, and use apps like this to train and improve your skills.

* Consistency is key to improvement. Practicing daily for as little as 5-10 minutes will help boost your skill level more than an hour of practice once every week.
